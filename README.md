## Understanding nodejs core concepts
This repo consist in a group of small script to test and understand some interesting topics like Streams, File System, Buffers, Network, Unix and Multi-Threading.

Check out the course I took, I highly recommend it: [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/109PLK3@9IO81oo7RwPf2yqP3HutAWGwLrglFiYZMcGFNEowCW3yHzbgiiKHWWc5W05QTBHt/)

Notice: i remove all the .txt files of this projects because some tests generate
files with 10gb of memory, so if you decide to copy some of this script please check if is necessary create a file before running the code.
