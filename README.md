## Understanding nodejs core concepts
This repo consists in a group of small script to test and understand some interesting topics like Streams, File System, Buffers, Network, Unix and Multi-Threading.

Check out the course I took, I highly recommend it: [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/109PLK3@9IO81oo7RwPf2yqP3HutAWGwLrglFiYZMcGFNEowCW3yHzbgiiKHWWc5W05QTBHt/)

Notice: I removed all the .txt files of this project because some tests generate
files with 10 GB of memory, so if you decide to copy some of this script, please check if it is necessary to create a file before running the code.
